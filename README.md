# MTG Standard Format Price

Magic: the Gathering has a variety of platforms where a player can choose to acquire cards.  The following data is sourced from MTGGoldfish.com, where they perform analyses of format metagames, and Scryfall.com, which hosts an exhaustive database of all MTG cards.  The goal of this project was to determine what popular Standard Decks cost on each platform so that a prospective player of the format can understand at a glance where they might want to invest their money.  There are other considerations when considering a platform to play on or deck to play, but an at-a-glance analysis of prices by platform is valuable.  Furthermore, many deckbuilding sites have information about paper and MTGO prices, but the idea of calculating a price for a deck in USD for MTG Arena is novel, and I developed a method for calculating this based on the store prices and information available about the in-game economy.
